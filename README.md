 Totally how many transactions have you done, check it from here: https://layerhub.xyz/search?p=monad_testnet

   
less > 10 txs = 75%

10-30 txs = 15.8% 

30-60 txs = 4.6%%

60-90 txs = 1.46%

< 100 txs = 2.42%

My suggestion is to do mini 50-70 quality transactions so that you remain completely safe.

Warning ⚠️: 3-5 transactions per day, you have to do transactions in 10-15 days ... not in one day.
