3) Totally how many transactions have you done, check it from here: https://layerhub.xyz/search?p=monad_testnet

   
less > 10 txs = 75%

10-30 txs = 15.8% 

30-60 txs = 4.6%%

60-90 txs = 1.46%

< 100 txs = 2.42%

My suggestion is to do mini 50-70 quality transactions so that you remain completely safe.

Warning ⚠️: 3-5 transactions per day, you have to do transactions in 10-15 days ... not in one day.

4) Fee Spent ($MON)
   
0.1 - 0.5 $MON = 89%

0.5 - 1 $MON = 7%

3 - 6 $MON = 0.68%

0.008-0.009 $MON gas fees pr TX.

Suggestion: 50-70 Quality transactions (7%)
